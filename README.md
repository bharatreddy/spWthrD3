A d3.js based webapp for spaceweather. The app uses node.js and express in the background.

The app pulls in Dst-index data from the mongodb database in the Virginia Tech SuperDARN lab and plots it for the entire year. There are options to switch years and zoom into a higher time resolution.

The app can be viewed at http://d3spaceweather.herokuapp.com/
